MissingOutputException in rule run_3plex_f in file /home/mmasera/3plex_backend_server/server/Snakefile, line 24:
Job 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
working_dir/ciao/output.txt
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
